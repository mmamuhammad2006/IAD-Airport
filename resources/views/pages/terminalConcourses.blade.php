                                        Terminal and the gates for domestic and international departure flights and domestic
                                        arrival flights. Passengers arriving on most international flights do not use the
                                        AeroTrain because they must first go through US Customs The Terminal Station is
                                        located beyond the TSA security checkpoints. Travel time of less than two minutes
                                        between stations.
