                                        companies. You can get from 118 USD a vehicle for 3 people. There are also 6-seater

                                        Reservations must be made at least 24 hours in advance and there is free
                                        cancellation up to 24 hours before. At the airport the driver will be waiting for
                                        you with a sign with your name on it, as soon as you leave the baggage claim area
                                        and enter the public arrivals hall. If you are in a hotel or apartment, the driver
                                        will be waiting outside the building. If you have the possibility to park your
                                        vehicle, sometimes you can wait for them at the reception.
